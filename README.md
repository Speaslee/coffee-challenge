# Coffee Challenge

![](https://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lu3oczVPyS1qc8uhwo1_400.gif)

Your mission, if you choose to accept it:

* Fork this repository into your own account
* Clone the fork down to your local machine
* Run the tests - you should see 1 error and 6 skips
* Work on fixing the error by implementing code in the `Person` and `Coffee` classes
* When that's passing, uncomment the `skip` in the next test
* Repeat until all tests are passing!

Note: this _will_ take longer than 20 minutes to complete entirely. Wrestle with the first couple, and get as far as you can in the time allotted.
